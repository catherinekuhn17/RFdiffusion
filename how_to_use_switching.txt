First, you need to have a "switching" motif composed of 2 contigs, where one contig rotates in respect to the other.
-An example of this is in examples/input_pdbs/HH_SQR.pdb and examples/input_pdbs/HH_TET.pdb

Then, you need to center one of these motifs, and then align the other motif by one of the contigs.
-A script for this is in helper_scipts/center_pdb.sh

Then, you need to generate the rotation/translation matrices to define the miton
-A script for this is in helper_scripts/generate_Rt_mat.sh

Finally, you can run RFdiffusion on these prepared motifs, usinf the config file switch.yaml and following the submission script examples/design_switch.sh
